**Note to Reviewer: You can ignore this file, or if you prefer you can use it as a sort of justification
for my process of creating the project.
I create this at the start of the project as a sort of blueprint for what i'll need to do, so i
have a guideline for the whole project. I'm no software engineer, but this helps.

COMPLETED Add internet permissions to Manifesto
COMPLETED Create a Movie Object class, add Constructor, Getter and Setter Methods
COMPLETED Create JSONUtils Class, Handle Parsing the JSON (Return Movie List).
COMPLETED Test with Sample Data
COMPLETED Create networkUtils Class to handle URL construction and HTTP requests
Base URL: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/
Sort: appendPath() popular or top_rated (according to settings)
API Key: appendQueryParameter ("api_key", <key>)
COMPLETED Create a MovieLoader Class to handle the async loading
COMPLETED Change MainActivity to Grid View
COMPLETED Create ImageAdapter Class for Grid Vew (Ref: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/gridview.html)
COMPLETED Setup the Adapter on MainActivity
COMPLETED Test with Sample Data
COMPLETED Hook up everything on MainActivity
COMPLETED Test the Grid with the Posters from the JSON response (Show Toast with title onClick)
COMPLETED Create a Settings Menu (PrefList Sort by: Popular / Top Rated) get it working (Pref Fragment, Activity, the works)
COMPLETED Create Detail Activity
COMPLETED in Main Activity change the onItemClickListner to Create a new intent to open the Detail Activity pass in the Adapter position
Actually passing a Movie Object (after making it Parcelable)
COMPLETED Create a Layout for the Details View and populate it with items from the JSON response list corresponding to the position passed in the Intent
(Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.)
COMPLETED format date from the string
COMPLETED Handle navigating back from both activities
COMPLETED Handle "No connection" Errors
COMPLETED Visual Polish (add loading indicators, maybe change the main activity Label according to sortOrder)
COMPLETED Make sure to remove hard-coded strings
COMPLETED Reformat Code, LINT and Test
COMPLETED Clean the build and Submit

::::::::::::::::::: STAGE 2 :::::::::::::::::::
COMPLETED Add 2 new Object types: Trailer (mName, site - disregard results that site != Youtube, key) and Review (Author, content)
COMPLETED Parse JSON response as these new objects

COMPLETED Add a new Movie Details Object + Parser (from "movie"/movieID endpoint) containing:
* Genres String[]
* mTagline String
* runtime int

COMPLETED Add a new Actor Object + Parser (uses the "credits" endpoint) containing:
* mCharacter String
* mName String
* profile_path String (uses the same URL as Poster path)

COMPLETED New Loader for these Objects
COMPLETED ListFragment and Adapter for Cast, Reviews and Videos.
Views:
**Cast:**
            mCharacter (Bold)
Profile
            actor

**Reviews:**
    Review
        "By" author

**Trailer:**

Youtube Logo    mName of the trailer (OnclickListener with intent to open video with key)

COMPLETED hook it up to details view
COMPLETED onSavedInstanceState passes the current fragment.

COMPLETED create a contract class for the DB

Data to pass:
 * id -> int (Automatic)
 * movie_id -> String
 * title -> String
 * poster_path -> String (full URL)
 * backdrop_path -> String (full URL)
 * vote_average -> float
 * release_date -> String
 * overview -> String
 * runtime -> int
 * tagline -> String
 * genres -> String

 (

schema:
CREATE TABLE movies.db(
_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
movie_id TEXT NOT NULL,
movie_title TEXT NOT NULL,
poster_path TEXT,
backdrop_path TEXT,
vote_average REAL NOT NULL,
release_date TEXT NOT NULL,
overview TEXT NOT NULL
runtime INTEGER,
tagline TEXT,
genres TEXT);

COMPLETED create Content Provider to add, remove and retrieve  the extended Movie object from a database
COMPLETED Setup the Save function on Details Activity
COMPLETED Setup the Delete Function on Details Activity
COMPLETED Setup the Search Function for Details Activity to change the state of the favourites button
COMPLETED Cursor loader to get all entries for the Grid View
COMPLETED Setup the Search Function to load Movie Arrays for Favourites and dipsplay as a grid
COMPLETED add a favourite button (Maybe a star with state changes - create a query to the DB to check if
MovieID exists in the Database, and change the state of the star accordingly OnCreate)
COMPLETED (Optional) when "Favourite" is selected, save the bitmap images to file so the movie details - Unecessary can just take advantage of Picasso's cached images.
can be viewed offline (not the trailers, that'd be murder on people's phones, also probably not a good idea to view cast and reviews offline (i mean saving all the cast images would be a pain in the ass, as would be to handle arrays of reviews)
COMPLETED Add a second extra to the DetailsActivity Intent with the "sortOrder"
Got SortOrder from preferences Instead (adding more extras to the intent was breaking the Parcelable)
COMPLETED Create a new constructor for the Movie Object to include MovieDetails.
COMPLETED Create a new method to get MovieDetails differently according to SortOrder
COMPLETED add a setting to show only movies from the array on the CURSOR (favourited)
COMPLETED (Optional) Share function for trailers
COMPLETED change the detailsview portrait mode to Relative layout, since constraint is having a hard time showing all items on lists.
COMPLETED polish and check fragment behaviours without network connection (perhaps create a defaultview Fragment with error text, or just hide Fragment and Buttons when no connection is detected)

TODO POLISH:
COMPLETED Review Strings
COMPLETED StreamLine "Launch Fragment methods"
COMPLETED check internet connection before launching fragments, displau "emptyview" if there isn't a connection
COMPLETED make sure landscape layout also works.
TODO Reformat code, LINT, clean build and submit!
